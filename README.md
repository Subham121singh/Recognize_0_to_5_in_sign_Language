# Recognize_0_to_5_in_sign_Language
In this project we are goig to train convolutional neural networks to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language.
Data has been taken from deep learning course coursera.
In this we are going to use Keras Deep learning frame work and tensorflow as backend.
Also in this project we would see how to save best weights and load again in same CNN architecture and use for prediction.
After training we got apprx 98% testing accuracy on data given for testing.
